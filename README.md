# KISS DS - Simple Data Structures

Simple Data Structures for C and C++, written in Pure C

## Why KISS-DS?

* Simplicity: Data Structure code shouldn't be coupled to a large codebase.
* Consistency: All Data Structures should use the same conventions & support standard operations
* Minimal: Each Data Structure should be self contained in one header/source file.
* Tested: Data Structure code should just work & have tests to validate behaviour.
